# SVG Parser
Individual course project for the OOP course during the second semester in Sofia University, FMI

This is a simple SVG parser and editor that supports only a limited set of shapes: rectangles, circles and lines.

Functionality:
* Parse a valid SVG file
* List all supported shapes found in a parsed file including their attributes
* Create any of the supported shapes by specifying their attributes
* Translate a shape or all shapes by a given pair of values (X, Y)
* For each shape, check if it is located within a specified rectangular or circular area
* Save all changes to the file being edited
* Save the modified file as a new file
